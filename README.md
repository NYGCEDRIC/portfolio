## Data Sources and Project Ideas

## Project Introduction: Where’s Schueller?

This visualization is part of a class project aimed at analyzing and displaying dining preferences based on geolocation data. The goal is to illustrate how visits to different locations correlate with meal times, using frequency data to highlight popular spots for coffee, lunch, and dinner. By leveraging data-driven insights, this project demonstrates an understanding of data visualization techniques and offers a practical example of mapping user behavior with enhanced hover details and color-coded meal categories.
